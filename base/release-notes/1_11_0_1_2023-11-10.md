# 1.11.0.1 Changelog

-   The AI will no longer try to claim your throne if it is not at least a count and has the appropriate personality
-   Only Powerful AI vassals will now try to claim your throne using the Iranian struggle rules
-   Iranian culture castles will now properly display the new Iranian Graphics
-   Fixed that Court Scholars were locked to owners of both the Royal Court DLC and Legacy of Persia. Just Legacy of Persia is now enough.

We hope this improves your experience with Legacy of Persia and the 1.11 "Peacock" Update released alongside it.
