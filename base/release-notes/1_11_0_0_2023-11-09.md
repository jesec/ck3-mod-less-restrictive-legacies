# 1.11 Peacock Changelog

## Legacy of Persia Features

-   Added the Iranian Intermezzo Struggle covering the conflict in Iran between the Caliphate and resurgent Iranian dynasties. The struggle can be ended by fulfilling one of three decisions or by triggering the “Concession” ending phase. During the struggle supporters and detractors of the Caliph will have access to new rules, decisions, interactions and events.
-   Added a new Dynasty Legacy: Brilliance, focusing on reclaiming the glory of the old dynasties of Persia.
-   Added a new UI Skin for Iranian Heritage cultures and characters living in the region.
-   New Portrait Assets: added new hairstyles, clothes, and beards in the Greater Iranian region.
-   Added many new events, decisions and interactions when playing in the Greater Iranian area relating to the new Struggle, Zoroastrianism, Islam, Clan realms, characters traveling in the Iranian Region, Tax Collectors, and more.
-   Added a number of new Cultural Traditions to Iranian culture: Fierce Independence, Pragmatic Creed, Jirga, Enlightened Magnates, Beacon of Learning, Irrigation Experts, and Frontier Warriors.
-   Added new types of Men at Arms: Asawira (unlocks within the Brilliance dynasty legacy), Tarkhan (unlocks from Frontier Warriors), Zupin (unlocks from Pragmatic Creed), and Tawashi (unlocks from Fierce Independence).
-   Added two Extra Tax Decrees when playing inside the Iranian region. Dehqan and Maguh. For more about tax decrees see Clan Vassals under Free Features.
-   Added a new Court Scholar court position for cultures with the Beacon of Learning cultural tradition. When employed, court scholars will over time increase in skill and good or excellent Court Scholars can be sponsored to create a Research Project inspiration, resulting in new innovations for your culture or new modifiers for your clan. Court Scholars also have an increased chance of gaining the book or alchemy inspirations.
-   Added a new Master Assassin court position which boosts murder schemes. Rulers with a faith that belongs to a faith with the Fedayeen tenet can recruit Master Assassins.
-   Added 3 new struggle music tracks as well as 3 new Persian Region Mood Tracks.

## Free Features

-   Added a new bookmark page for Iran in 867, with recommended playable characters and biographies.
-   House Unity is a new measure of the internal stability in the ruling house of a Clan realm. Unity comes in 5 levels, from Antagonistic to Harmonious and is shaped by the actions taken by clan members towards each other. Clans with high unity levels will enjoy a high level of internal stability while making conquest harder while those with a low unity level will be better at conquering new lands but be internally unstable. Each level unlocks special rules, decisions, interactions and abilities.
-   Clan Vassals can now be assigned to Tax Jurisdictions, handled by a Tax Collector. Depending on the aptitude of the Tax Collector and what Tax Decree is assigned to the Jurisdiction the associated Vassals will provide and enjoy different benefits and penalties. The existing Vassal obligations, Ghazi, Iqta and Jizya, are now Tax Decrees in the new system.
-   Viziers: Clan realms of duchy tier or above can now assign a landless character to be their Vizier. Viziers provide extra tax jurisdictions and their aptitude helps all tax collectors in the realm. The more empowered they are the bigger the benefits, though Viziers may also try to embezzle your funds. Vizier excesses can be fined via the Mulct interaction. A Vizier can also substitute your spouse in the confidant counselor position, if you desire.
-   When starting in 867 the Turkic Seljuk dynasty will now invade Iran in the late 10th century, an associated game rule can regulate when the invasion happens.
-   Added event chain for the Zanj Rebellion in lower Mesopotamia shortly after the start of the 867 campaign.
-   Added a number of new special buildings in the Iranian region: The Minaret of Jam, the Walls of Gorgan, Alamut Castle, Falak-ol-Aflak Citadel, the Dome of Soltaniyeh, The Rainbow Mountains, the Imam Reza Shrine, the Sar-i Sang mines, the Ark of Bukhara, the Tomb of Batsheba, and Maharloo Lake Necropolis of Rostam, Tomb of Cyrus the Great, Palace of Ctesiphon, and the ancient Mines of Sar-i Sang.

## Balance

-   Cost for disinheriting bastard children or children with disputed heritage is lowered. If the illegitimacy is a secret and the father knows the secret, the cost is lowered and the secret is revealed.
-   Certain Wars will now resolve quicker, as the warscore from battles and attacker occupations have been increased by 150%: conquests (county & duchy), holy war (county & duchy), subjugation, vassalization, struggle clash, border raid, expel interloper, and excommunication war.
-   Conquest & Invasion CBs now have a dynamic cost scaling with realm size, this should make the CB's cheaper for smaller realms and more expensive for very large ones.
-   Chthonic Redoubts are no longer impossible to convert in Mountains (-75% instead of -100%).
-   De Jure CBs are now available one era earlier than before.
-   Forming the HRE is now possible using any core Carolingian kingdom, not just East Francia, and the De Jure can now include the Empire of Francia if West Francia or enough Francian kingdoms are part of the realm of the one forming the HRE.
-   Rebalanced the Piety & Prestige costs for Conquests and Invasions to make them more accessible for smaller realms.
-   Reduced prestige gain from Amenities and exceeding your Grandeur level.
-   Reduced prestige gain from the Marauder Accolade.
-   Removed all sources of prestige % gain bonus from innovations to reduce inflation (total 20%).
-   Significantly reduced Prestige gain from Artifacts (monthly gains, prestige per dread/knight, etc).
-   Slightly reduced prestige % bonuses from Diplomacy lifestyle perks.
-   Slightly reduced prestige from the Bodyguard position.
-   Switched some innovations around for Arabic Heritage cultures so that the Caliph can revoke titles on game start.
-   The AI should now have a much easier time forming the HRE from an 867 start.
-   The AI no longer pays Prestige to revoke Court Positions, as they would never abuse court positions in the first place - and the prestige loss would cause them to fairly often be unable to declare wars.
-   The Mongols now get better Siege Engineer characters.
-   The Mongols now have a bonus to cavalry damage and toughness, to offset their lack of Stationing Bonuses.
-   The Mongols now spawn with trebuchets instead of mangonels.
-   Harm events will no longer target the player by default, only the AI.
-   Increased the odds of successfully getting through harm events unscathed from 80:20/50:50/60:40 for poor/average/good options to 40:60/60:40/70:30.
-   Reduced the overall likelihood of harm events of all kinds by an order of magnitude (except for the general incapability due to age chainlet), and of incapability foreboding events specifically by a further half again.
-   Camel cavalry accolade only gives bonuses to camel cavalry.
-   The Create Cadet Branch is now available for Clan Members only if they are in another realm than their House Head.
-   Some common activity pulse actions now grant mystic lifestyle experience for pilgrimages and witch rites.
-   If you have an epiphany about the sanctity of nature during a hunt you will also get some mystic lifestyle experience (this is another activity pulse action, though somewhat rarer than the very common one for pilgrimages).
-   You will get Mystic Lifestyle experience for visiting points of interest in religious sites and wonders while traveling. This is not restricted to religious sites of your own religion, and it also means it's easier to get mystic XP once more grand cathedrals are built up later in the game.
-   Added Mystic Lifestyle experience to some events, mainly travel ones that already had to do with mystics.
-   Holding a mystical communion will grant some mystic xp.

## AI

-   Lowered the value of higher tier alliances and increased the penalty for Female above 30 years.

## Interface

-   Character modifiers can be now clicked and display an expanded view of all existing modifiers. Players can now see all modifiers on the character, and not only the first 10 items.
-   Show a difficulty warning in the lobby for rulers in regency.
-   Remove decision\_custom\_widget\_container option from decision configuration window.
-   Remove decision\_has\_second\_step for decisions. Now if a decision needs to use the custom step, the decision must specify decision\_to\_second\_step\_button.

-   Added steam rich presence for Iberian Struggle.

Scripted characters are now found in the priority just above base modifiers, with priority 2.
-   Art Script: Changed the old way of assigning accessories to scripted characters. Instead of per-accessory we now do per-character. So, each character has a single entry in a single file where all their accessories are added. This goes for developer characters as well.
