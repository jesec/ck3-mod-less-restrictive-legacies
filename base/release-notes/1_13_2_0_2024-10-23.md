Good day everyone! We're releasing an update today to tackle some balance, bugfixes and interface issues affecting Roads to Power and the associated 1.13x "Basileus" Update. Notable changes include the addition of a game rule to limit the amount of adventurers in game and Administrative governments having a new "Realm" interface. See the changelog below for a full list of changes.

# PC Update 1.13.2 Changelog

## Expansion Features

-   Administrative government now has access to a new tab in the “Realm” interface, listing additional laws that can be changed independently of imperial bureaucracy to allow an administrative top liege to have greater agency and control over their realm.
    -   Added a new law for administrative to prevent governors from using the boundary dispute and subsume governorship schemes, ensuring that your internal borders stay somewhat more constant over time.
    -   Added a new law for administrative, which allows the top liege to prevent governors from declaring external wars.

## Free Features

-   Added a new game rule to limit the amount of adventurers in a game.
-   Added a new game rule to adjust the amount of damage gained by point of advantage in battles.
    -   Options include 1, 2, 5, 7, and 10.

## Game Balance

-   Default damage adjustment is now 5% per advantage in battles, down from 10%.
-   The martial lifestyle perk “Strict Organization” now provides increased governor efficiency for administrative rulers.
-   Increased the cost of refilling MAA with provisions by 68.75% for adventurers.
-   Rebalanced cost and bonuses of the great tower of silence.
-   The stewardship lifestyle perk “Detailed ledgers” now provides some additional administrative vassal tax obligation for administrative rulers.
-   Increased the base levy obligation for administrative to 30%, up from 10%. While admin has less levies in general, there is no need for the governors to keep that many levies for themselves.
-   Civilian themes no longer provide less levies to the liege. They are meant to generate income and provide development, which means that they have less reason to keep their levies than other administration types.
-   When a populist faction sends their demands to a ruler with a state faith, the ruler can only choose to change the state faith if the faction’s faith is of the same religion as they are, or if the faith covers a majority of their realm (60% or more of the realm’s counties).
-   Enabled raiding for governors of frontier themes, allowing them to raid neighboring realms.
-   Governors will now spend a higher portion of their income on men-at-arms. This should prevent governors from disbanding their troops too easily when their governor efficiency changes, or when they are replaced by a new governor with a lower efficiency.
-   The emperor now has 0 candidate score for appointment, making sure to avoid inheriting titles needlessly if there are others in the line of succession with low scores.
-   Significantly reduced the likelihood and frequency of the AI asking for a council position (not accounting for when they force themselves onto the council).
-   The “Men-at-Arms” innovation in the high medieval era now increases the size of title MAAs by 1.
-   Reduced the amount of gold you receive from dividends when you found a holding as a landless adventurer.
-   Added a grace period after you take the “Stand with Us” contract. No longer will you be called out as an “Oathbreaker” if the war immediately ends and you have no time to join it.
-   Increased the chance of a vassal governor to accept, and to accept without making any demands, when you ask them to end their war.
-   Asking a vassal to end their war now takes the Loyal and Disloyal traits into account, increasing and decreasing acceptance respectively.
-   Higher levels of imperial bureaucracy now increases republican tax obligation in addition to administrative tax obligation.
    -   Level 3 provides a base +5%, while level 4 provides a base +10%, bringing the total obligation to +30% at maximum bureaucracy.
-   In an effort to make sure that titles are created at a rate we want them to within an administrative realm, administrative government now has an innate -50% title creation cost bonus.
-   AI vassals will no longer adopt a state faith if their top liege follows the same faith as they do. If the emperor can have it, then so can we!
-   Non-admin vassals will only consider to adopt a state faith if their faith hostility is low enough, and will not adopt it by themselves if they consider the state faith hostile or evil.
-   Enabled the “Demand Administrative Governance” interaction towards republics, allowing you to convert mayors into admin.
-   Lowered the defensive advantage the vassal gains from frontier administration to 6, down from 8.
-   Lowered the coastal advantage the vassal gains from naval administration to 10, down from 15.
-   Updated acclamation succession to take the palace politics cultural tradition into account for reducing candidate score based on disfigurement. Not having this tradition will no longer reduce a candidate’s score if they are blind, disfigured, infertile, etc.
-   Increased the penalty to a candidate's score for appointment succession when of the non-preferred gender to -80%, up from -66%.
-   Made it a bit easier for vassals to convert with you when creating a new faith when you also have a state faith.
    -   If you hold a lot of sway within the realm (i.e. you have high diplomacy, learning, legitimacy, influence level, is part of a powerful family, etc.) vassal acceptance will increase.
    -   Additionally, having the Prophet lifestyle perk will increase acceptance based on your diplomacy and learning.
-   The “Influence candidacy” interaction no longer requires the target character to belong to a noble family. This allows you to promote lowborn and nobles who have yet to become a noble family to governorships, without having to resort to revoking a governorship and using “Grant Appointment.”
-   The AI will no longer force others to join their faction if they themselves were forced to join.
-   The influence option in the “Force to join faction” interaction can no longer be used on characters who actually like their liege.
-   Administrative can now adopt the cultural tradition “City Keepers”.
-   Administrative vassals who are not a part of your de-jure can now be granted independence.
-   Administrative rulers can now grant independence to tribal vassals who are a part of their de jure.
-   Made it more expensive for administrative to convert tribal holdings, increasing the base cost by 25%. Admin should not want to conquer tribal land, but rather wait until someone else does it first and make it more civilized.
-   Moved 1 MAA limit from the Roaring campfire building to the Swords-for-Hire and Legitimist camp purposes directly in order to promote specialization.
-   Moved one MAA max size from the Proving Grounds to the Lockwagon building (unlocked by Freebooters, Swords-for-Hire, and Legitimists) in order to promote specialization.

-   Moved knight efficiency from Proving grounds to Roaring Campfire.
-   The base acceptance for the “Make a Request” interaction has been reduced to 0 (down from +30).
-   AIs are now less willing to give adventurers gold using the “Make a Request” interaction just because the adventurer is poor.
-   AIs now give less gold when adventurers use the “Make a Request” interaction.
-   AIs will no longer give adventurers using the “Make a Request” interaction more gold if they have 25+ opinion of them. It now only counts being friends/lovers.
-   Best friends/soulmates will give adventurers more gold when using the “Make a Request” interaction.
-   Requesting a new contract now only reduces opinion by -5, and the AI gets +30 acceptance for the request.
-   AIs are now less willing to give adventurers gold using the “Make a Request” interaction if they themselves are poor (from -10 to -30).
-   AIs are now less willing to give maa using the “Make a Request” interaction if the adventurer is powerful (-25 at 400 max strength, -50 at 800 max strength).
-   AIs are now less willing to give maa using the “Make a Request” interaction if the adventurer is stronger than themselves (using max troops count).
-   Reduced the acceptance bonus for the “Make a Request” interaction based on your prestige level (from 10, 20, 30, 40 to -> 5, 10, 20, 30).
-   Lowered opinion malus from demanding artifacts.
-   Rebalanced options in stewardship\_wealth.1051.
-   Significantly lowered gold costs in travel\_events.2013.
-   Removed stress from opting out of buying a trinket in travel\_events.4036.

-   The AI will now avoid calling players to war if the player is in debt.
-   Increased difficulty for adventurers attempting to chain church-robberies.
-   Added an upper limit to gold reward from the “Stand with Us” contract of 1 yearly income of the employer and their current gold.

-   You can no longer start the depose scheme if you are disfigured, blind, etc. and the top liege has a culture that frowns upon these traits in regards to succession (e.g. the palace politics tradition).

-   Fixed the description not always showing for the depose scheme interaction.
