Women who serve as governors in Celestial realms will be referred to by their correct titles.

\[\*\]

Winning a faction war to install a ruling regent no longer imprisons the ceremonial liege. 

\[\*\]

Empire titles not part of a Hegemony can now de jure drift into a bordering Hegemony

\[\*\]

Empire titles undergoing de jure drift are now striped on the Hegemony map mode.

\[\*\]

Fixed edge case where a Councillor being moved from one Council to another would be fired from the new position. This also fixes potential crashes if the Councillor is a Minister in the Hegemony of China.

\[\*\]

Fixed edge cases where Ministries could cause crashes.

\[\*\]

Fixed issue where the Grand Campaign great project would not be correctly removed if cancelled. 

\[\*\]

Fixed bug where under certain circumstances no one could host a local exam in independent celestial realms. 

\[\*\]

Nomads AI migrating into a county will correctly evaluate the opponent - the top liege instead of county holder. It should prevent some suicidal migrations.

\[\*\]

Removed the unnecessary requirement to own the Royal Court to be able to use the Iron Cavalry tradition.

\[\*\]

\[\*\]

Fixed duplicated characters in “A Resplendent Acclamation” (ep3\_governor\_yearly.3060) due to new ceremonial lieges.

\[\*\]

Kamuyism faiths use steppe temple backgrounds rather than the generic fallback.

\[\*\]

Removed some trivial Coronations memories and rewrote others to be more consistent with memory style.

\[\*\]

Reduced instances of southern Dharmic temples appearing in East Asia.

\[\*\]

Fixed generated characters appearing dead in Coronation ceremony phase events.

\[\*\]

Updated administrative triggers in Coronation events so that East Asian admin characters will more often get Influence instead of Prestige.

\[\*\]

Removed often-buggy memory names from the event text in “Coronation: Shared Memories” and other events.

\[\*\]

Blocked Ministers from being eligible claimants for any title that isn’t the Hegemony of China. This would often lead to issues where other rulers could push their claims in a different realm to make them leave China proper. 

\[\*\]

Fixed inconsistent triggers for the Administrative Family Attributes, causing them to show up for Japanese rulers in some cases when they should not. 

\[\*\]

Fixed missing AI modifier in “Subsume Province” scheme. Now the AI can go back to its scheming ways.

\[\*\]

Fixed missing text in the bad permafrost modifier. Now the bad modifier will properly tell you how bad permafrost is. Spoilers: it’s cold.

\[\*\]

Fixed the permafrost modifier not working as intended when changing liege. Now the bad modifier is activated when a character of a culture without permafrost buffs takes over an area with permafrost.

\[\*\]

Disabled regnal numbering for Celestial, Meritocratic, Meritocratic Khanate, and Japanese government rulers.

\[\*\]

The decision “Join Movement” will now cost Prestige if you don't have access to Influence. 

\[\*\]

The tooltip cost for Housing Reconstruction in Natural Disaster Recovery projects no longer names the Minister of Revenue's skill as the reason for the cost modifier when it's actually the Minister of Works’ skill that matters. 

\[\*\]

Updated the tooltip for the Minister of Works, listing additional great projects the minister has access to that weren't mentioned.

\[\*\]

Fixed incorrect map tooltips when within the Ritsuryō admin tab.

\[\*\]

The “Ask for Governorship” interaction will no longer show titles of the same tier (or higher) than your top liege's primary title.

\[\*\]

The Byzantine tradition of preventing characters with various disfigurements did not always work as intended.

This should now be fixed.

\[\*\]
