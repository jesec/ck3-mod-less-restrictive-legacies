-   Fixed a crash that could happen if a domicile is spawned without a valid location
-   Fixed a crash that could happen if you manage to switch to an unplayable character

-   Fixed the effects of the Peace of the Great Khan decision that caused some steppe counties to be turned into republics

## Balance

-   Lowered efficiency of reinforcing MaA with Herd from 0.75 to 0.4 (1 MaA is now 2,5 Herd, up from 1,3)
-   Lowered efficiency of reinforcing MaA with Gold for Nomads from 4 to 1.5 (1 MaA is now 0.66 Gold, up from 0.25)
-   If suffering from a Chaotic Succession, it's now a 3/4 chance of receiving the Major consequences if you qualify for them (up from 1/4), and a 2/3 chance to suffer from medium consequences if you qualify for them
-   Made the 'Realm Split' outcomes of Chaotic Succession more common
-   Made non-nomads care about fewer positive Tributization modifiers, and made them less likely to want to willingly submit to nomads in general (tribals are slightly more likely than feudals)
-   Added a -25 County Control penalty to Counties gained via the Demand Pastureland interaction
-   Added Growth penalties to Herders and Settled Rulers during a Severe Drought (-0.5), White Zud (-2) and Cold Zud (-1) to make it harder to keep high fertility by releasing/demanding pasture land
-   Increased the Fertility Decline from White Zud (40% to 80%) and Cold Zud (30% to 40%) for Nomadic rulers
-   Reduced the Fertility Growth percentage during a White Zud (-40% to -80%) for Herders and Settled Rulers
-   Added an immediate Fertility reduction for Herders when a bad season starts (-50 during a White Zud, -25 during a Cold Zud, -10 during a Severe Drought)
-   Added County Control reduction when a bad season takes over for Nomadic rulers in all held counties: -25 for a White Zud and Havsarsan Zud, -10 for Cold Zud
-   Added Herd loss during a White Zud for Nomadic rulers: 10% of their current herd during a White Zud, 20% during a Havsarsan Zud
-   Increased the Herd Gain penalty for Nomadic rulers during a Severe Drought (-5% to -10%), White Zud (-10% to -40%) and Havsarsan Zud (-30% to -80%)
-   Added Prestige loss to the failure outcome of the Steal Herd scheme
-   Reduced the initial max success chance of the Steal Herd scheme (from 40 to 30)
-   Reduced base acceptance for the Negotiate Obedience character interaction (from -50 to -95) and added a medium Prestige cost scaling with Dominance level
-   Removed White Zud from the possible initial seasons on game starts, and rebalanced the chances for the others (40% Abundant Grazing, 20% Severe Drought, 20% Cold Zud, 20% Everlasting Summer)
-   Reduced the base Prestige gain from a Great Nerge from 300 to 250
-   Reduced the base Prestige gain from an Excellent Nerge from 400 to 350, and the Gold from 350 to 250
-   Halved the values of all Herd gained through the Raid Intents and fixed the tooltips to reflect this: from 400% to 200% for Pillage, from 200% to 100% for Capture, from 600% to 300% for Plunder and from 400% to 200% for Adventure
-   Reduced the base reluctance of the recipient for the Pledge Tribute character interaction (from -100 to -50)
-   Added new Cultural Traditions to the Hunnic culture: Pastoralists, Horse Breeders and Recognition of Talent
-   Lowered the exchange ratio obtained through the Summon Wealthy Visitors decision if the Herd Barter domicile building is constructed: from 6:1 to 10:1 in levels 1 and 2, from 4:1 to 8:1 for levels 3 and 4 and from 2:1 to 6:1 for levels 5 and 6
