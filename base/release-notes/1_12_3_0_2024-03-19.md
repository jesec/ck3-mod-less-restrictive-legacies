Hello everyone! Today we're releasing Update 1.12.3 to address some issues reported to us by the community as well as deploy a couple of balance tweaks. Notably for our MacOS and Linux users, this update merges in the previously experimental fix for crashes related to tooltips and mousing over portraits. A huge thank you goes out to the community for providing their crash reports and insights on this issue!
