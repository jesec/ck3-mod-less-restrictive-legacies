### Special note for MacOS and Linux users

Due to an issue with how Steam treats filename capitalization, you may need to completely uninstall and reinstall Crusader Kings III to avoid stability issues. We are aware of an unrelated crashing issue on these platforms. If you experience crashing, please try the fix above and [submit a bug report](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/how-to-report-a-bug-please-read.1583048/) if the issue persists afterward.
